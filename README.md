# Blackjack
Looking to create a game of Blackjack 
It is a game of blackjack where you say how many decks you are going to play with (minimum of 2) and how many people are playing.
You then get dealt 2 random cards from the decks per person
These cards are then taken away from the cards in the deck so they can't be usedd again
You are asked if you wish to stick or twist.  The dealer has to stick on 17 or above but must twist on 16 or less
You can keep twisting until you reach 21 or over.  over 21 you are declared bust
Winners are those who's cards tally more than the dealer but not exceeding 21.  If dealer and player get blackjack, dealer (house) wins
Asked if you would like to continue.  The cards are then put to the side and not counted back into the deck.  The winners get a tally point against their name
